## adding ethernet 24 interfaces to bridge named sw ##
for i from=1 to=24 do={/interface bridge port add bridge=sw interface="ether$i"}

## MTU adjusting ##
; before any mtu adjustment be sure that mtu discovery is working properly
; mtu discovery uses ICMP protocol by reaching the remote router
; it is possible to find the apropriate value for MTU by using: ping remote-ip do-not-fragment size=1500 
; after find the max transmission unit you can ping with size: ping remote-ip size=65535 and check if fragmentation is working!

ping 192.168.1.1 do-not-fragment size=1500
ping size=65535
